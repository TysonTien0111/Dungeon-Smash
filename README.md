Stats Explained
Attack Stat(1 - 10): This is just the attack stat of the character, it is used to
determine how much damage the character can deal.

Health Stat(25 - 50): This is the health stat of the character, it is used to
determine how long they can last in battle. 

Armor Stat(1 - 10): This is the armor stat of the character, it is determines how much
damage reduction they have. it scales all the way up to 50%. 

Guard Status(True or False): This is the guard status of the character, it determines whether
or not they are on guard. If they are, they will have access to weakening
strike. Weakening strike is explained below. 


Abilities Explained
Weakening Strike: Similar to sword strike it seems as if it is just a basic slash to the opponent,
however, the strike is laced with magical incantations that has a chance of
detonating, shredding the opponent's armor stat by 2.

Sword Strike: Pretty much self-explanatory, just a basic slash to the opponent,
it is unfortunately not laced with magical incantations to enhance its strike.
